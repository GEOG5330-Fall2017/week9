# Question 1
The 'trees2.csv' file in the Data folder is a subset of Joshua tree location we
used for last week's homework and raster measurements of climate conditions
('ext5.grd') for the same area.  Please add your lines codes in the following
snippets of the codes to address the question I put in the comments:

```{r hw5, eval=T, echo=T}
# plot the trees 
library(sp)
library(maptools)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
library(dismo)

locs = read.csv(file="Data/trees2.csv", header=T)

# The following codes are to generate psuedo-absence tree locations as background data

coordinates(locs)=c('lngitude', 'latitude')
proj4string(locs) = CRS('+init=epsg:4326')

x = circles(coordinates(locs), d=50000, lonlat=T)
bg = spsample(x@polygons, 1000, type='random', iter=1000)

# The following codes are to load the climate conditions raster datasets
clim = brick('Data/ext5.grd')

plot(clim, 1, cex=0.5, legend=T, mar=par("mar"), xaxt="n", yaxt="n", main="Annual mean temperature") 
map("state", xlim=c(-119, -113), ylim=c(33.5, 38), fill=F, col="cornsilk", add=T)

# Take a look at the presence and background data of trees
points(locs, col='red')
# psuedo-absense
points(bg, col='blue')

# The following codes are for extracting bioclim values for locations of
# presences and psuedo-absense data

presence_bc = extract(clim, coordinates(locs)) # for the presence points
bg_bc = extract(clim, bg) # for the pseudo-absence points

# Now, put all the data including presence locations and related climate conditions into a data frame
presence_bc = data.frame(lon=coordinates(locs)[,1], lat=coordinates(locs)[,2], presence_bc)

# And, do the same thing for background pseudo-absence data

bg_bc = data.frame(lon=coordinates(bg)[,1], lat=coordinates(bg)[,2], bg_bc)

length(which(is.na(bg_bc$bio1))) # double-check for missing data
bg_bc = bg_bc[!is.na(bg_bc$bio1), ] # and pull out the missing values

group_p = kfold(presence_bc, 5) # divide the presence data frame into 5 groups 
group_a = kfold(bg_bc, 5) # same for bg_bc

## We are almost ready to run the maxent. 
## To do this, you need to set up `maxent' method in the `dismo` package.
## The maxent package can be downloaded from:
## https://github.com/surfcao/geog5330-fall2018/blob/master/week5/maxent.jar.
## Download the downloaded the maxent.jar file and copy it to the # folder
## specified by the following 'jar'. You will also need to install the 'rJava'
## package. Then you should be ready to go. Please let me know if you have
## trouble installing this. 

jar <- paste(system.file(package="dismo"), "/java/maxent.jar", sep= '') 
jar

## Till this point, all the data preparation has finished. Now your turn.
##  Based on the k-fold results, choose one group (say group 2) as your
##  validation dataset, and use the other four groups as your training
##  data. Use MaxEnt to generate a presence probability map of Joshua
##  trees, plot it, output the accuracy measure. Please identify the
##  climate conditions that affect the most to the Joshua tree
##  distribution and explain how. The sample codes can be found at the MaxEnt ##  section of the sample codes used during the lecture.

pres_train <- presence_bc[group_p != 2, ]
pres_test <- presence_bc[group_p == 2, ]

backg_train <- bg_bc[group_a != 1, ]
backg_test <- bg_bc[group_a == 1, ]



```
